I wrote this java mini project to understand better how to use git and github. 

In this second version i created a GUI and now you can also stop playing the song and starting it again running the code only once.
you still have to put a file called "musica.wav" inside the project for it to work. For the next version i wanna browse a file explorer and the user can choose it from anywhere in the computer.
